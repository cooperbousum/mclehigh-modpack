# Install Instructions
You will need an instance of minecraft 1.21.1 neoforge (version 21.1.209)
### Option 1 (zip)
Click the top right download button and download this repository as a zip file. Then, extract its contents into your minecraft instance's mods folder.
### Option 2 (git)
Clone this repository into your minecraft instances main folder 
```
git clone https://github.com/cooperbousum/mclehigh-modpack.git
```
This will probably be called .minecraft or minecraft, then rename the created directory to `mods` (overwrite your previous mods folder)

### Post-Installation
Feel free to add your own client-side mods, as these are not required to be on the server to work.
